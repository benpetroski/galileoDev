Steps followed:
- Downloaded Arduino IDE, installed driver, blah, blah, blah.
- Updated firmware on device.
- Tested board with basic blink sketch.

Results:
- First upload of blink sketch yielded no results. Looked at common errors, didn't seem to be one.
- Tried changing the board in the tools menu from Intel Galileo Gen 2 to Intel Galileo. This worked even though I am pretty sure I have a Gen 2 board.
